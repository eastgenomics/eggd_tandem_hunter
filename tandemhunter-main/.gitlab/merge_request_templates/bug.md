# Checklist

- [ ] Clear title and description of what the changes fix.
- [ ] Reference to a relevant issue.
- [ ] Labels to indicate what level of change is being proposed (Major, Minor,
      Feature, Bug Fix).
- [ ] A reviewer assigned.
- [ ] A ChangeLog entry.
- [ ] Appropriate tests - the majority of changes will necessitate tests. Only
      very minor changes will not. This will be clarified by the reviewer.
- [ ] Updated documentation - where appropriate.
- [ ] An indication of the level of validation required - if the output used for
      downstream analysis could be affected by the changes then a higher
      level of validation will be required.
- [ ] Integration testing performed. Are the results as expected?
